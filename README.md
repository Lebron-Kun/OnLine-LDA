# On-Line LDA (OLDA)

* Rencently,I studyed LDA topic model and some variants of it,which has been widely used in textual analysis and data mining.

* This variants of LDA called On-Line LDA which focus on identifying emerging topcis of text streams and their changes.

* The original paper is as follows: **L Alsumait, Barbar , Daniel , C Domeniconi.,On-Line LDA: Adaptive Topic Models for Mining Text Streams with Applications to Topic Detection and Tracking.** (<http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/23798256.pdf>)

* Due to the limitation of the corpus,On-Line LDA model don't work well on task of my project.But it has inspired me a lot and I spend few days to implement the code. 

* However,not all the code has been implemented.Feel free to contact me if you find any problems in this package.
